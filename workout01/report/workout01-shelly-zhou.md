### Introduction:

As one of the best teams in NBA, Golden State Warriors attracts a tremendous amount of attentions all year around. Every good basketball team relies heavily on its players, and Golden State Warriors does not lack the well performing ones. Here we analyze some of the best players on this team, and see how these big names were actually performing with their knowly "amazing" abilities and compare them with each other. The player we're looking at are Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry. To be more precise, we will be looking at their shot statistics from season 2016.

In a typical game a player can usually score in three ways, through a faul, a 2-point field goal, or a 3-point field goal. To score a 3-point field goal, a player must be standing on or outside of the outmost line from the basket classifying the territory of a team on the playground. Therefore, the positions that the players are playing largely determines the players shooting range and what kind of goals that the players can get. There are generally five positions that a player can play in a basketball game, point guard, shooting guard, power forward, center, and small forward. They usually stand in different places and cover the whole range to defend and offend. A shooting guard is responsible for scoring points, especially 3-point field goals, where as a center usually scores a lot of 2-point field goals. The rest of the position can vary. Here, we have Stephen Curry as the point guard, Klay Thomson as the shooting guard, Kevin Durant as the small forward, Draymond Green as a power foward, and Andre Iguodala as shooting guard or small forward.

### Effective Shooting Percentage

One effective way to see how players are performing is to calculate the effective shooting percentage, which is the ratio of made field goals to total field goals. In this case, we would be looking at 2-point field goals alone, 3-point field goals alone, and the overall shooting performance.

### 2 PT Field Goal Statistics

The table below shows the total 2-point field goal attempted, made, and their ratio for each of the five players we mentioned above. As we can see, besides Graymond Green, everyone can actually score at least half of the attempted 2-point goals they had, and even Mr.Green is very close to half. Andre Iguodala is able to take the lead on this one, but we also have to note that he participated in less games. Kevin Durant is very close to Andre in terms of effectiveness, but had the most attempts as well.

| name           |  total|  made|  perc\_made|
|:---------------|------:|-----:|-----------:|
| Andre Iguodala |    210|   134|   0.6380952|
| Kevin Durant   |    643|   390|   0.6065319|
| Stephen Curry  |    563|   304|   0.5399645|
| Klay Thompson  |    640|   329|   0.5140625|
| Draymond Green |    346|   171|   0.4942197|

### 3 PT Field Goal Statistics

This table gives us the same information about the 3-points field goals associated with each player. Here, the picture changed a lot. The best a player can do, is only scoring about 40% of the attempted 3-points field goals. With the nature of being farther away, even these amazing players cannot take a big win against the 3-points field goals. In this case, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry have the highest scoring ratio, who also have the highest number of attempts, where as everyone else has only about a third of the attempts that they have.

| name           |  total|  made|  perc\_made|
|:---------------|------:|-----:|-----------:|
| Klay Thompson  |    580|   246|   0.4241379|
| Stephen Curry  |    687|   280|   0.4075691|
| Kevin Durant   |    272|   105|   0.3860294|
| Andre Iguodala |    161|    58|   0.3602484|
| Draymond Green |    232|    74|   0.3189655|

### Overall Field Goal Statistics

| name           |  total|  made|  perc\_made|
|:---------------|------:|-----:|-----------:|
| Kevin Durant   |    915|   495|   0.5409836|
