# Workout 2
In this workout assignment, a shiny app is develped for visualizing the return from different investment options. You're allowed to choose the number of years, rate of return, growth rate, initial deposit and annual contribution for your investment. You can see the accumulative value over time and compare between no contribution, fixed contribution and growing contribution. You can choose to facet the graph or not, and a table is also provided to you.  

The folder investment contains the R script file that writes the shiny app.
